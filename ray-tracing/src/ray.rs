    /*
    In ray tracing, we define a Ray as a mathematical representation of a path through 3D space. This can be expressed as:
    Position(t)= Origin+tâ‹…Direction
    Position(t): The 3D point along the ray.
    Origin: The starting point of the ray.
    Direction: A vector indicating the ray's path.
    t: A parameter that moves along the ray; changing its value lets you traverse the line in both directions.
